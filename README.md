Challenges Faced

1- GSAP Split Text Animation – Understanding and applying the Split Text effect was tricky, but I managed to implement it successfully.
2- Hero Section Design – The given design in the assignment was challenging, but I created it according to my understanding.
3- Managing Tailwind classes – Handling multiple utility classes was a bit confusing initially.
4- Deployment issues – Faced some minor errors while deploying but resolved them.
5- at last if more time is given i think expectations can be met
